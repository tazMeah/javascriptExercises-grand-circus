	<pre>Prompt: 'Pick a number from 1 to 100.' > <span id="input1"></span></pre>
	<pre>Output: <span id="answer1"></span></pre>
	<li>Write   a   do..while   loop   that   builds   a   string   with   multiple   inputs   from   a   user.   Start   by prompting   the   user   if   they   want   to   play.   When   the   user   answers   yes,   prompt   the   user   to enter   a   word.   After   the   user   enters   a   word,   prompt   the   user   if   they   would   like   to   play   again. If   no,   console   log   their   word.   If   yes,   prompt   the   user   for   another   word   and   add   that   word   to the   original   string,   then   prompt   if   they   want   to   play   again.   Continue   to   add   words   to   the string   every   time   the   user   answers   yes   and   enters   a   word   until   the   user   indicates   that   he   or she   does   not   want   to   play   anymore.</li>

		Write   a   while   loop   that   will   prompt   the   user   if   they   would   like   to   print   their   name.   If   the answer   is   yes,   log   their   name   to   the   console   then   prompt   them   if   they   would   like   to   print their   name   again.   If   yes,   log   their   name   to   the   console   again   but   this   time   add   an exclamation   point   at   the   end   of   the   string.   Continue   to   add   an   exclamation   point   for   every time   the   user   agrees   to   wanting   to   print   his   or   her   name. <em>Won't we have to ask them their name first?</em>

		Prompt   the   user   for   a   time   of   day   (morning,   noon,   or   evening).   Based   on   their   input,   log   a string   to   the   console   that   will   let   the   user   know   what   they   should   be   eating   for   that   specific meal.   Use   the   tables   below   to   guide   your   logic.
